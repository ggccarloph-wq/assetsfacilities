/**
 | The requestor's half of an emergency cancellation.
 |
 | After the Facilities Office releases a confirmed venue, the requestor is
 | asked one question: keep the venue and move the date, or keep the date and
 | move to another venue. Whichever they pick goes back to the office as a
 | proposal -- it is not applied on its own, because the new slot still has to
 | be free.
 |
 | Nothing here writes to an approval column. The Adviser, Dean, SDAO and the
 | directors signed the activity, not the timeslot, so their signatures stay
 | exactly as they were through the whole exchange.
