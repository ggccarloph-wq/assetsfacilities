 * role that the Super Admin assigned in Account Management, not by whoever is
 * filling out the form.

 * Every module (Asset Management charge slips and FMO activity proposals) asks
 * this class instead of running its own query, so there is a single definition
 * of "who signs" and only one place to change if that ever becomes more than
 * one person per role.
